    //Colors and optional elements
    Your first stop for customizing this HUD will be the clientscheme. 
    You can find it in custom/hudname/resource.
    .res files can be opened with text editors such as Notepad++. 

    You will find instructions on how to change colors and enable/disable certain elements in the clientscheme.

    //Main Menu
    You can enter your name for the main menu in /resource/ui/MainMenuOverride.res

    The bottom right star button can connect you to your favourite server.
    You'll need to add 
   
    //Home Server Button
    alias Home "connect <insert server IP>;password <insert password>"
    
    to your autoexec in order to make the "Home Server" button work.
